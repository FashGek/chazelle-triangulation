        Assume G is connected.
        Partition the vertices into levels according to their distance from some vertex v.
        L[l] = # of vertices on level l
        If r is the maximum distance of any vertex from v, define additional levels -1 and r+1 containing no vertices
        l1 = the level such that the sum of costs in levels 0 thru l1-1 < 1/2, but the sum of costs in levels 0 thru l1 is >= 1/2
        (If no such l1 exists, the total cost of all vertices < 1/2, and B = C = {} and return true)
        k = # of vertices on levels 0 thru l1.
        Find a level l0 such that l0 <= l1 and |L[l0]| + 2(l1-l0) <= 2sqrt(k)
        Find a level l2 such that l1+1 <= l2 and |L[l2] + 2(l2-l1-1) <= 2sqrt(n-k)
        If 2 such levels exist, then by Lemma 3 the vertices of G can be partitioned into three sets A, B, C such that no edge joins a vertex in A with a vertex in B,
        neither A or C has cost > 2/3, and C contains no more than 2(sqrt(k) + sqrt(n-k)) vertices.
        But 2(sqrt(k) + sqrt(n-k) <= 2(sqrt(n/2) + sqrt(n/2)) = 2sqrt(2)sqrt(n)
        Thus the theorem holds if suitable levels l0 and l2 exist
                Suppose a suitable level l0 does not exist.  Then, for i <= l1, L[i] >= 2sqrt(k) - 2(l1-i)
                Since L[0] = 1, this means 1 >= 2sqrt(k) - 2l1 and l1 + 1/2 >= sqrt(k).  Thus l1 = floor(l1 + 1/2) > 
                Contradiction

        Now suppose G is not connected
        Let G1, G2, ... , Gk be the connected components of G, with vertex sets V1, V2, ... , Vk respectively.
        If no connected component has total vertex cost > 1/3, let i be the minimum index such that the total cost of V1 U V2 U ... U Vi > 1/3
        A = V1 U V2 U ... U Vi
        B = Vi+1 U Vi+2 U ... U Vk
        C = {}
        Since i is minimum and the cost of Vi <= 1/3, the cost of A <= 2/3. return true;
        If some connected component (say Gi) has total vertex cost between 1/3 and 2/3,
        A = Vi
        B = V1 U ... U Vi-1 U Vi+1 U ... U Vk
        C = {}
        return true

        Finally, if some connected component (say Gi) has total vertex cost exceeding 2/3,
        apply the above argument to Gi
        Let A*, B*, C* be the resulting partition.
        A = set among A* and B* with greater cost
        C = C*
        B = remanining vertices of G
        Then A and B have cost <= 2/3, g
        return true;

        In all cases the separator C is either empty or contained in only one connected component of G
